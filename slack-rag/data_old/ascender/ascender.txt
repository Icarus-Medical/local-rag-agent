Intent ID: ASCENDER_KO_BRACE_HEIGHT
Title: Standard brace height for Ascender KO
Canonical Answer: 8.5" above the knee and 7.5" below the knee.
Trigger Examples:
What’s the brace height for Ascender KO?
Standard height above and below knee?
KO dimensions for top and bottom?

Intent ID: ASCENDER_KO_CUSTOM_ENGRAVING
Title: Custom engravings and logos
Canonical Answer: We can engrave any text, with the patient’s last name as standard. Custom logos are available with an upcharge and a provided image.
Trigger Examples:
Can you engrave custom text on Ascender?
Do you offer logo engraving?
Add patient’s name to KO brace?

Intent ID: ASCENDER_KO_VARUS_VALGUS
Title: Varus and valgus correction capability
Canonical Answer: Braces are designed to neutral alignment. We can build in varus or valgus correction to a requested degree, or we can use our own correction calculation.
Trigger Examples:
Can you make KO brace with varus correction?
How about valgus correction in Ascender?
Adjust alignment for KO brace?

Intent ID: ASCENDER_KO_POSTERIOR_CUFF
Title: Posterior calf cuffs availability
Canonical Answer: Posterior calf cuffs can be used only as an approved special request and with an upcharge.
Trigger Examples:
Can Ascender KO have a posterior calf cuff?
Do you offer back calf cuff?
Posterior cuff option for KO brace?

Intent ID: ASCENDER_KO_SCAN_REQUIREMENTS
Title: Scan requirements for Ascender KO
Canonical Answer: A scan is good enough if it clearly includes the knee center with at least 270 degrees of coverage, making the condyles clearly visible, and extends 8 inches above the knee and 7 inches below the knee. If any of these requirements are not met, get another scan.
Trigger Examples:
Is this KO scan good enough?
How much coverage is needed in scan?
Scan criteria for Ascender KO?

Intent ID: ASCENDER_KO_SHORTEN_BRACE
Title: Shortening the brace
Canonical Answer: Yes, we can shorten the top and bottom frame by 1” each without changing the strapping system. For requests greater than 1” shortening, the engineering team must confirm design feasibility.
Trigger Examples:
Can you shorten Ascender KO?
Reduce brace height by 1 inch?
Custom short KO brace request?

Intent ID: ASCENDER_KO_LENGTHEN_BRACE
Title: Increasing brace length
Canonical Answer: Yes, we can increase the length of the brace by 2” on the top and bottom frame; however, there are strength and durability downsides to this design change.
Trigger Examples:
Can you make KO brace taller?
Lengthen brace frame by 2 inches?
Increase top and bottom frame length?

Intent ID: ASCENDER_KO_CENTRALIZED_DIAL
Title: Centralizing the dial on the brace
Canonical Answer: Yes, but this requires an additional design charge as it significantly increases design time.
Trigger Examples:
Can the KO brace dial be centered?
Put dial in middle of Ascender KO?
Custom dial position for KO brace?

Intent ID: ASCENDER_KO_HIGH_BMI
Title: Accommodating high BMI patients
Canonical Answer: We will create a rigid frame with thicker cross-sectional area to minimize the risk of breakage, and we will shorten the top frame according to height and weight.
Trigger Examples:
KO brace for high BMI patient?
Reinforce Ascender for heavy patient?
Adjust KO brace for tall and heavy user?
