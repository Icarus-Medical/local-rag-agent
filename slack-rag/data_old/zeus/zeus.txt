Intent ID: KAFO_SCAN_MISSING_FOOT
Title: Hercules KAFO: Scan missing foot/ankle
Canonical Answer: Yes, only if we have a KC to floor measurement and the scan covers a majority of the tibia below the knee.
Trigger Examples:
scan doesn’t include foot — can we still make Hercules KAFO?
missing ankle in scan okay for Hercules order?
partial lower leg scan acceptable for Hercules KAFO?
Hercules KAFO scan incomplete at foot area

Intent ID: KAFO_NO_KC_MEAS
Title: KAFO without KC-to-floor measurement
Canonical Answer: Yes, only if the scan extends cleanly to the bottom of the foot and the clinic accepts liability for any reprint due to KC-to-floor misalignment.
Trigger Examples:
no KC to floor measurement — can we proceed with KAFO?
missing KC-floor number for Hercules order
forgot KC-floor, but scan shows entire foot

Intent ID: KAFO_POSTERIOR_THIGH_CUFF
Title: Posterior thigh cuff on Zeus or Hercules patient
Canonical Answer: No.
Trigger Examples:
Can Zeus have a posterior thigh cuff?
Hercules brace with posterior thigh cuff possible?

Intent ID: KAFO_ASCENDER_OVER_AFO
Title: Fitting Ascender over an AFO
Canonical Answer: What you are likely looking for is a Hercules, which is a KAFO, or a knee brace connected to an AFO.
Trigger Examples:
Can I fit Ascender over an existing AFO?
Will Ascender work with my AFO?


Intent ID: KAFO_CUSTOM_AFO_SCAN_REQUIREMENT
Title: Need to ship custom AFO to HQ for KAFO build?
Canonical Answer: No. However, we require a good scan of the AFO either on the patient or on its own (or both). If you want the AFO to be detachable from the KO, we require an unobstructed scan of the cuff of the AFO, with straps moved away from the peg attachment location. This approach requires the clinician to attach the AFO themselves.
Trigger Examples:
Do you need the physical AFO for KAFO?
Can I send a scan instead of shipping the AFO?

Intent ID: THRIVE_AFO_HIGH_BMI
Title: High BMI / short patient fit into Thrive AFO?
Canonical Answer: Except for extreme cases, yes. If you are worried about fit, consider recommending a posterior AFO over an anterior AFO, as they are more flexible and can expand to fit the patient’s leg.
Trigger Examples:
 Can high BMI patients use Thrive AFO?
 Short patient — will Thrive AFO fit?

Intent ID: KAFO_HEIGHT_WEIGHT_REQUIREMENT
Title: Why height and weight required for KAFO order
Canonical Answer: The patient’s height and weight are required to ensure the brace height is correct and doesn’t sit too high on their leg.
Trigger Examples:
Why do you need height and weight for KAFO?
KAFO order form asks for height/weight — why?
