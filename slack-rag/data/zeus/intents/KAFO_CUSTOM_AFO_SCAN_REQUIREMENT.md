# KAFO_CUSTOM_AFO_SCAN_REQUIREMENT

## Intent ID
KAFO_CUSTOM_AFO_SCAN_REQUIREMENT

## Title
Need to ship custom AFO to HQ for KAFO build?

## Canonical Answer
No. However, we require a good scan of the AFO either on the patient or on its own (or both). If you want the AFO to be detachable from the KO, we require an unobstructed scan of the cuff of the AFO, with straps moved away from the peg attachment location. This approach requires the clinician to attach the AFO themselves.

## Trigger Examples
- Do you need the physical AFO for KAFO?
- Can I send a scan instead of shipping the AFO?
