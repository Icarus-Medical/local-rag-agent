## Intent ID: THRIVE_AFO_HIGH_BMI
### Title: High BMI / short patient fit into Thrive AFO?
### Canonical Answer: Except for extreme cases, yes. If you are worried about fit, consider recommending a posterior AFO over an anterior AFO, as they are more flexible and can expand to fit the patient’s leg.
### Trigger Examples:
- Can high BMI patients use Thrive AFO?
- Short patient — will Thrive AFO fit?
