# KAFO_NO_KC_MEAS.md

## Intent ID: KAFO_NO_KC_MEAS
### Title: KAFO without KC-to-floor measurement
### Canonical Answer: Yes, only if the scan extends cleanly to the bottom of the foot and the clinic accepts liability for any reprint due to KC-to-floor misalignment.
### Trigger Examples:
- no KC to floor measurement â€” can we proceed with KAFO?
- missing KC-floor number for Hercules order
- forgot KC-floor, but scan shows entire foot
