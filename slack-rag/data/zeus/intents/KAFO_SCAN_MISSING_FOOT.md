## Title
Hercules KAFO: Scan missing foot/ankle

## Canonical Answer
Yes, only if we have a KC to floor measurement and the scan covers a majority of the tibia below the knee.

## Trigger Examples
- scan doesn’t include foot — can we still make Hercules KAFO?
- missing ankle in scan okay for Hercules order?
- partial lower leg scan acceptable for Hercules KAFO?
- Hercules KAFO scan incomplete at foot area
