ADONIS_UNLOADING_ADJUSTMENT

## Title
Adjusting unloading force for different patients or conditions

## Canonical Answer
Yes, the amount of unloading can be adjusted by modifying the strap tension and, in some designs, by changing the hinge angle or using modular inserts. By tightening or loosening the upper and lower straps, you can increase or decrease the corrective force applied across the knee joint. This allows clinicians to fine-tune the unloading effect based on patient size, severity of osteoarthritis, or comfort preferences.
