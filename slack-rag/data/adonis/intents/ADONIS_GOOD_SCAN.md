## Title
What makes a good scan for an Adonis brace order

## Canonical Answer
A good scan is accurate, clear, and shows all anatomical landmarks. The limb should be in the correct position, without rotation or movement, to ensure proper alignment. The scan must capture the full area needed for the brace, both above and below the joint, with no missing data or distortion. Lighting and scanner calibration should be optimized to avoid glare or shadows. The final scan should be clean, with smooth surfaces, no artifacts, and exported in the correct file format with proper scale and orientation.
