## Title
How the Adonis brace unloads the medial or lateral compartment of the knee

## Canonical Answer
The brace applies a corrective three-point pressure system that shifts the joint load away from the affected compartment. For medial unloading, it creates a valgus force by anchoring above and below the knee and applying outward pressure on the lateral side. For lateral unloading, it reverses that with a varus force. This redistributes the load toward the healthier side of the joint, reducing compressive forces on the damaged cartilage and alleviating pain during weight-bearing.
