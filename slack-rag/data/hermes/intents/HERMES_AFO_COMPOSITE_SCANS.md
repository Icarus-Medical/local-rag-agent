## Intent ID: HERMES_AFO_COMPOSITE_SCANS
### Title: Compositing two incomplete scans into one complete scan
### Canonical Answer: Yes, but it takes a very long time and can be inaccurate, so we donâ€™t do it.
### Trigger Examples:
- Can you merge two partial scans for an AFO?
- Possible to combine incomplete scans?
- Can two scans be stitched together for Hermes AFO?
