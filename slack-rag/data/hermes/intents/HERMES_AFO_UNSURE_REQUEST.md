## Title
What to do if clinician asks for something we might not do

## Canonical Answer
Call an engineer. Even if the answer is “no,” we love to hear about the clinician’s needs for future products, and we might be able to solve their problem in other ways.

## Trigger Examples
- Clinician requested something unusual — what now?
- Not sure if we can make what clinician wants — who to ask?
- Request outside standard AFO options — how to proceed?
