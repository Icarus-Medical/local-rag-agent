# ASCENDER_KO_SCAN_REQUIREMENTS

## Title
Scan requirements for Ascender KO

## Canonical Answer
A scan is good enough if it clearly includes the knee center with at least 270 degrees of coverage, making the condyles clearly visible, and extends 8 inches above the knee and 7 inches below the knee. If any of these requirements are not met, get another scan.
